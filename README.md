### Setup

You can install this node in 2 ways:
1. ComfyUI Manager — Search for `FASHN Virtual Try-On` and click `install` <br> —— or ——
2. Clone the repository into your `custom_nodes` folder in ComfyUI
```bash
cd custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/fashn-AI/ComfyUI-FASHN.git
```

### Using the API Key

You can provide the API key to the node in 2 ways:

1. [Recommended] Set the environment variable `FASHN_API_KEY` to the API key you created on the FASHN platform. <br> —— or ——
2. Directly paste the API key into the node's `fashn_api_key` field. <br> *This is less recommended because you might accidentally expose your API key when sharing your workflow.*

### Quick Start

An example workflow, as shown in the screenshot above, is provided in a `workflow.json` file in this repository.
